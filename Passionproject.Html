<h2>History of the World Cup</h2>
<p>The World Cup is a soccer competion that began in the year 1930, organized by Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). <br>
    It was then held every four years
    except for the time during World War 2. From 1930-1970 there was a diffrent award called the Trophy Cup,<br> which was permently awarded in 1970 to Brazil when they won their 
    third world cup.<br>
     After their third World Cup a new trophy was fought for which was the FIFA World Cup. 
</p>
<h2>How the World Cup is won</h2>
<p>Every four years the world cup happens. This is because they need time to find the best 32 teams to compete in the finals. It starts with 4 groups. Two countires face off
    and if one wins then they are awarded with 3 points. If it is a draw then they get 1 point. If the country loses then they get no points. When all of the countries have 
    faced eachother, the two countries with the most points go on ot the round of the last 16. When the last 16 countries, 2 of the sixteen countries are drawn to face eachother in
    for a place into the quarterfinals. Half the teams are now in the quarterfinals. Again two teams at a time are drawn to face eachother, to play for a place in the semi-finals. After
    the 4 teams in the semi-finals face off the two winners face off in the World cup finals. The winner is then awarded the world cup trophy. Look at the picture below so better understand the world cup brackets.
